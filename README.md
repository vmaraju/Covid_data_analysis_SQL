Chinese Loans to Africa (CLA) project
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio project which is a real data of Chinese loan given to African countries from year 2000 to 2020. The Chinese Loans to Africa (CLA) Database is a data project tracking loan commitments from Chinese policy and commercial banks, government entities, companies and other financiers, to African governments and state-owned enterprises. As of March 29, 2021, the CLA Database is managed by the Boston University Global Development Policy Center.

I used this dataset to find out :

Which country received the maximum loan
Which lender gave the maximum loan
What types of projects are heavily funded by Chinese government in Africa
Project - Analyze International Debt Statistics
PostgreSQL project in Jupyter notebook for analyzing international debt statistics using data from world bank.


What is the average debt across countries?
What is the maximum debt indicator?
Which country has the highest debt in which debt indicator etc.
